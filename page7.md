## Preparation of the Headset

3. Check the electrodes and electrode cables for signs of wear and
  tear.  **Please note: If equipment is damaged, contact the study
  coordinator and do not proceed with treatment.**

4. Prepare the Sponges:

    a Place the sponges in the kidney dish side-by-side:

    b. Pour roughly 24ml of saline into the clear plastic container.

    c. Draw up 6mL of saline with the needless syringe (Figure
  4.2). **Please note: saline is the only option. Please do not use
  water.**

    d. Apply 6mL evenly to EACH side of the sponge in a zig-zag manner as
    shown in Figure 4.3 (12mL for each sponge in total).  
    **Please note:
    Ensure that the saline covers the dry areas of the sponge on each
    side.**

5. Place Sponges:

    a. Turn the swimming cap inside out, fold the cap in half and place it
  on a table surface so that the bottom of the cap is towards you and
  the clips are on the top (Figure 5.1).

    b. Place a sponge in front of each clip so that the closed sides are in
  left side and the open sides are on the right (Figure 5.2).

    c. Slide the sponges onto the forks of the clips. It helps to lift the
  fork of the clips up to give space for the sponge (Figure 5.3)

6. Insert Electrodes:

    a. Untwine the electrodes and leads and place them on a table.

    b. Place the BLUE lead electrode next to the BLUE clip.

    c. Place the RED lead electrode next to the RED clip.

    d. With the FLAT side of the electrode facing upwards towards the
  ceiling and away from the white clip, insert the BLUE lead electrode
  into the sponge of the corresponding BLUE clip and the RED lead
  electrode into the sponge corresponding RED clip (Figure 6.3).  **DO
  NOT put the electrodes under the white clips as this could impair
  stimulation/damage electrodes. Electrodes may fall out of the
  sponges from time to time. STILL do not clip down the electrodes.**

    e. Ensure that the BLUE leads and RED leads are facing the same direction
      when the cap is placed on the table.
