## Guidelines for Treatment

During treatment, you want your brain activity to be ‘neutral’, meaning
you want to be relaxed but alert. It is important that you do not
participate in any activities that require mental effort as this can
prevent the treatment from having long-lasting effects on your memory
and thinking abilities.

| Acceptable activities | Why?                             |
|-----------------------|----------------------------------|
| Sitting / laying down | It doesn’t require mental effort |
| Light TV/podcast      | It doesn’t require mental effort |

| Activities to avoid                             | Why?                                                                                       |

| Drinking coffee/tea before treatment            | Coffee stimulates the brain, interfering with the effects of tACS                          |
| Reading                                         | It may activate parts of the brain we are targeting.                                       |
| Using the computer or mobile phone              | It may activate parts of the brain we are targeting.                                       |
| Talking to people for extensive periods of time | It may activate parts of the brain we are targeting.                                       |
| Physical activity (e.g. gardening, cleaning)    | It may activate different parts of the brain we are targeting and impact hormonal changes. |
| Sleeping / Meditating                           | It lowers brain activity to a minimal level which may counteract the stimulation’s effect. |
