    e. Wipe the rubber electrodes with an alcohol swab. This is in important
      part of equipment maintenance. The electrodes can accumulate saline in
      ridges which may affect the delivery of the treatment (Figure 15.2).

    **DO NOT put water on the electrodes. Do not put under the tap or soak.**
