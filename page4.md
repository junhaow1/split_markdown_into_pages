## Equipment Descriptions

The *BrightStim* home-kit includes the headset, yellow sponges, two
electrodes connected to leads, *Brightstim* device, kidney dish,
alcohol swabs, bottled saline, needleless syringe and a clear plastic
container.  Each item is important for a different stage of treatment
which is outlined in the step-by-step user-manual.

| Headset:                              | ![](media/image3.png)  | Used to secure the electrodes in the correct location and ensures that the electrodes are in close contact with your scalp for optimal brain stimulation. |
| Yellow sponges:                       | ![](media/image4.png)  | Used to connect the rubber electrodes to the Bright-Stim device.                                                                                          |
| Rubber electrodes connected to leads: | ![](media/image5.png)  | Used to deliver the stimulation produced by the Bright-Stim device.                                                                                       |
| *Brightstim* device:                  | ![](media/image6.png)  | Produces the stimulation                                                                                                                                  |
| Kidney dish:                          | ![](media/image7.png)  | Used to organise and hold required materials for stimulation so that they are in one location for easy access and use.                                    |
| Alcohol swabs:                        | ![](media/image8.png)  | Can be used to clean the electrodes and equipment after treatment                                                                                         |
| Saline:                               | ![](media/image9.png)  | Used to dampen the sponges so that they become soft and increase electrical conductivity of electrodes.                                                   |
| Needleless syringe:                   | ![](media/image10.png) | Used to extract saline from inside the saline bottle.                                                                                                     |
| Clear plastic container:              | ![](media/image11.png) | Used to collect saline in order to extract with the needleless syringe                                                                                    |
