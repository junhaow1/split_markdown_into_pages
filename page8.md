## Applying the Headset

7. Apply the headset:

    a. Remove hair accessories so that hair hangs loosely. Earrings can
  stay in.  ** Any metal may cause problems with stimulation
  conductivity and potentially cause painful sensations to the scalp.**

    b. Hold the headset in front of your forehead (Figure 7.1) and place the
  front sponge (with RED lead) over your forehead (Figure 7.2).

    c. Hold the front of the headset against your forehead with one hand
  and pull the back of the headset backwards until it covers the head
  (Figure 7.3).

    d. When you have applied the headset as instructed above, using a nearby
    mirror, ensure the following (Figure 7.4):
  
    + The front edge of the cap sits just above your eyebrows.
  
    + Line up the centre of the cap (marked with a black line) to the
    midpoint between your eye brows.
  
    + The cap must cover your ears.
  
    + The cap must fit snuggly on your head.
  
    + Ensure the electrode leads are facing outward and away from your
    face.

    e. Hold the heads of the clips and firmly rub the scalp beneath in a
  circular motion for 10 seconds (Figure 7.5).  **To make sure that
  rubbing has not displaced the cap, recheck the previous
  instructions.**
