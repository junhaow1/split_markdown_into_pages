12. IF the connection is poor between the electrodes and your scalp:

    1. Add another 6ml saline to sides of the sponges that make contact with
      your scalp (Figure 12.1).

        *Please note on your self-report form if you add more saline.

        *Ensure that the sponges are not too saturated that the saline is leaving the
    sponge. If this happens you could be connecting electrode to electrode, not
    electrode to scalp, in which case the treatment is not reaching your brain.

    2. Firmly rub the sponges to your scalp
    3. Check that the electrodes and leads are connected properly by pushing the
      leads into each hole firmly (Figure 12.2).

        Once you have completed these steps, undertake steps 9-10 again to begin
    treatment.
